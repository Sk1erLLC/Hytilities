Open your preferred IDE, in this example we will be using [IntelliJ](https://www.jetbrains.com/idea/).
You can choose the "Community" tab if you do not already own the Ultimate version.

<!--- todo: include images here instead of a lot of text. i don't have ij 2020.2 currently, and the context menu on 2020.3 eap is incredibly different. -->
On IntelliJ's main menu, press the button that says "Check out from Version Control", click "GitHub", 
and paste the URL to the "Git Repository URL" text field. If you want to change the directory it will be cloned to, 
change the "Parent Directory" text field. Once you are done changing where you want it to be, click "Clone", 
then wait for it to finish. Once prompted with "You have checked out an IDEA project file: [file location]. Would you like to open it?", 
press the "Yes" button.

Once it is done cloning, click on the Gradle tab on the very right sidebar.
